# Time Series Analysis using R 

I am assuming you already have some background in regression analysis / econometrics with some R programming experience. 

# arima.aic.R: 
In this code, I will be forecasting different test sets by using ARIMA(p,d,q) which is an ARIMA model and its orders are determined while minimizing the Information Criterions from the training set. 
Once the optimum order for the ARIMA(p,d,q) is determined by minimizing Information Creterion from the traning set, I will use that model to forecast..

# WILL BE UPDATED
